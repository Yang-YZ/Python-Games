# Cookie Clicker

Cookie Clicker is a game built around a simulation in which your goal is to bake as many cookies as fast as possible. 
The main strategy component of the game is choosing how to allocate the cookies that you have produced to 
upgrade your ability to produce even more cookies faster.

In Cookie Clicker, you have many options for upgrading your ability to produce cookies. 
Originally, you can only produce cookies by clicking your mouse. 
However, you can use the cookies you earn to buy other methods of producing cookies (Grandmas, farms, factories, etc.). 
Each production method increases the number of "cookies per second" (CPS) you produce. 
Further, each time you buy one of the production methods, its price goes up. 
So, you must carefully consider the cost and benefits of purchasing a production method, 
and the trade-offs change as the game goes on.

The project implements a simplied simulation of the Cookie Clicker game. 
There is no graphical interface and therefore no actual "clicking". 
Instead, you could implement different strategies (always buy the cheapest item, 
always buy the most expensive item, always buy the best item) 
and see how they fare over a given period of time as a plot.
