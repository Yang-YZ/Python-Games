# Memory Card Game

Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. 
In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. 
If they match, the player leaves them face up. 
If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. 
The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the
minimum number of turns. For simplicity purposes, keep the model fairly simple. 
A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.
