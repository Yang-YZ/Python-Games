# Asteroids and Spaceship

This is a 2D space game that is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids (1979).
In the game, the player controls a spaceship via four buttons: two
buttons that rotate the spaceship clockwise or counterclockwise (independent of its
current velocity), a thrust button that accelerates the ship in its forward direction and a
fire button that shoots missiles. Large asteroids spawn randomly on the screen with
random velocities. The player's goal is to destroy these asteroids before they strike the
player's ship.
