# Fifteen Puzzle Solver

The project solves the Fifteen Puzzle which was popularized in the 1800's by Loyd. 
The original version of the Fifteen puzzle consists of fifteen tiles numbered one to fifteen that lie on a 4 X 4 grid. 
Since there are sixteen spaces in the grid, one of the spaces is empty.

This version of the puzzle starts in an initial conguration where the tiles numbered one to three lie on the top row (left to right), 
tiles four to seven lie on the next row down, tiles eight to eleven lie on the third row, 
and tiles twelve to fifteen lie on the bottom row with the blank space starting in the upper left corner.

[0, 1, 2, 3],

[4, 5, 6, 7], 

[8, 9, 10, 11], 

[12, 13, 14, 15]

To manipulate the puzzle, the player can slide the blank space into a tile adjacent to the blank space by entering "l" "r" "u" "d", 
meaning go left, right, up, and down. Repeating this process scrambles the order of the tiles. 
Clicking "Solve" button will bring the tiles back into its initial conguration.
