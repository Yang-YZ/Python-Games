# Monte Carlo Tic-Tac-Toe Player

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple children's game played on a 3 x 3 grid. 
Players alternate turns placing an "X" or an "O" on an empty grid square. 
The first player to get three-in-a-row wins. 

For this project, we implement a machine player for Tic-Tac-Toe. 
Specically, the machine player will use a Monte Carlo simulation to decide its next move. 
We will provide both a console-based interface to the game where your machine player will
play against itself and a graphical user interface where you can play against your machine player.
