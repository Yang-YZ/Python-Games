# Monte Carlo Tic-Tac-Toe Player

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple children's game played on a 3 x 3 grid. 
Players alternate turns placing an "X" or an "O" on an empty grid square. 
The first player to get three-in-a-row wins. 

For this project, we implement a machine player for Tic-Tac-Toe. 
Specically, the machine player will use a Monte Carlo simulation to decide its next move. 
We will provide both a console-based interface to the game where your machine player will
play against itself and a graphical user interface where you can play against your machine player.

# Mini-max Tic-Tac-Toe Player

An alternative strategy to play the game. 
This machine player for Tic-Tac-Toe uses a Minimax strategy to decide its next move. 
Although the game is played on a 3 X 3 grid, your should be able to assign any square grid.
However, the time it will take to search the tree for larger grid sizes will be prohibitively slow.
